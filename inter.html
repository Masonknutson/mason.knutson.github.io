<h2>Baseball</h2>

<p1>Ever since I was five-years-old I have played baseball. Baseball has always been my favorite sport to play. I played every position in the infield except short-stop. In high school I started at second-base and third-base. Baseball has given me the opportunity to bond with my father and other peers better than any other form of socialization could. My favorite professional team is the Boston Red Sox. My favorite professional player is Dustin Pedroia.

<h3>Beach</h3>

<p2>The beach is my sanctuary, my paradise, and a lovely place to catch a tan. From the second it becomes warmer than 70 degrees you can find me at the beach. My friends and I will hangout at the beach for hours on end, we wear sunscreen do not worry. Sometimes we will have cornhole tournaments, in which me and my friend Emma always win. My favorite beach is at Watch Hill in Westerly, Rhode Island. On this beach there is an old abandoned fort covered in the most interesting grafitti.
