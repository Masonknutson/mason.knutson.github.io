<h1>My Hometown</h1>
<p1>I was born in Waterford, Connecticut. Waterford is a medium sized town located between New London and East Lyme. There is not much to do around town except go to the beach or the mall.

<h2>My Early Education</h2>
<p2>I attended my local public school from pre-k to tenth grade. Then after tenth grade I transfered to Saint Bernard School, a catholic school associated with the Xaverian Brothers. I transfered schools to delve into a new environment to broaden my social, educational, and religious horizons.
