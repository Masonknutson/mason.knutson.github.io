<h1>Summer Job</h1>
<p1> This summer, coming into college, was the first time I ever had an actual job. I worked the food services at the Wadawanuck Club, in Stonington Connecticut. This was an amazing experience. I felt I truly lucked out by having the coolest bosses. I enjoyed going to work everyday because my co-workers were respectable and easy-going. During the lunch hours I was a server, but during the dinner hours I was the dishwasher.
